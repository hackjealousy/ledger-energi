Support for Energi Masternodes on the Ledger Hardware Wallet

This repo consists of two things:

1. Additions to the Ledger Bitcoin application to support signing Energi
   (and probably Dash, I haven't checked) Masternode Broadcast messages
   with the collateral key.  (Thus allowing one to keep their
   masternodes on a Ledger.)

2. A simple wallet program / collection of scripts that allows one to
   send Energi transactions and sign Masternode Broadcast messages.
